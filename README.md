# Scrape_Inc5000
Creating an ETL to scrape INC5000 data and export data to be used for further analysis

Found hidden API in INC5000 backend through the Network > Fetch/XHR tab tab 
  allowing the extraction of information directly from the backend server in the form of a JSON object.
  Information available dated back to 2010 despite the site only detailing information from the past 5-years.
