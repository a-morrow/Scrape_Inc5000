# Web Scraping INC5000
Creating an ETL to scrape INC5000 data and export the data to be used for further analysis (company, industry, competitor)

Found API in INC5000 backend through the Network > Fetch/XHR tab tab 
allowing the extraction of information directly from the backend server in the form of a JSON object.
Information available dated back to 2010 despite the site only detailing information from the past 5-years.
